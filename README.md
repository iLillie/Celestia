# Celestia
Celestia is an full-stack system for the upcoming website ItJakt.  
The goal is for an easy system to keep track of jobs you are hunting for, and quality of life features.

## Motivation
I saw there wasn't a norwegian system available that could quickly help me keep track jobs I'm hunting for.
It was intended to be a system for myself, but got feedback to make it public.

## Technology
### Frontend
Nuxt3 Release Candidate for front-end with Tailwind CSS.  
I decided to go with Nuxt3 as I learned about auto-import,
and Tailwind css as I wanted to go out of my comfort zone to learn one of the CSS frameworks.

### Backend
ASP.NET Core 6.0 Web Api for back-end with EF Core.

I decided with ASP.NET Core as I've used it before,  
and how much resources there are to help me build up Celestia.
